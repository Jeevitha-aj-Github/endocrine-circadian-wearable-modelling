Endocrine Circadian Rhythm Modelling & Wearable Data Integration
Overview

This project simulates circadian hormone dynamics under real-world noise conditions and integrates multimodal wearable streams (heart rate, temperature, activity) to explore robust parameter estimation in digital endocrinology.

The goal is to model dynamic hormone profiles under low signal-to-noise environments and evaluate noise-aware computational strategies for stable rhythm estimation.

Objectives

Simulate 24-hour circadian hormone rhythms

Introduce controlled noise and variability

Compare classical parameter estimation vs noise-robust modelling

Integrate synthetic wearable streams (heart rate, temperature)

Demonstrate multimodal time-aligned analysis

Methods

Cosinor-based circadian modelling

Gaussian noise injection across SNR regimes

Monte Carlo evaluation

Multimodal time-series synchronisation
